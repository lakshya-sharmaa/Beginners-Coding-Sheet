# My Coding Journey

## Introduction
Welcome to my coding journey repository! I'm a beginner in the world of programming, and I've decided to document my learning process by solving basic coding questions. This repository contains my solutions to questions from a beginner coding sheet that covers various topics such as loops, conditionals, and more.

## Learning Path
I've structured my learning path to cover the following languages:

1. C
2. Python
3. JavaScript
4. Java

## Folder Structure
- **c_programs:** Contains my solutions to coding questions in C.
- **python_scripts:** For Python solutions.
- **javascript_code:** For JavaScript solutions.
- **java_programs:** For Java solutions.

## Coding Sheet
I'm using a beginner coding sheet (located in the root directory as [BEGINNER'S CODING SHEET.PDF](https://github.com/lakshya-sharmaa/Beginners-Coding-Sheet/blob/main/BEGINNER'S%20CODING%20SHEET.pdf) ) to guide my learning. Each section of the sheet corresponds to a programming topic, and I aim to solve the associated questions in each language.

## Repository Navigation
Feel free to explore the folders corresponding to each language to find my solutions. You can click on the links below to directly access the solutions:

- [C Solutions](c_programs/)
- [Python Solutions](python_scripts/)
- [JavaScript Solutions](javascript_code/)
- [Java Solutions](java_programs/)

## Contribution
As a beginner, I'm open to feedback and suggestions! If you have any tips, improvements, or alternative solutions to the problems I've solved, please feel free to create issues or pull requests.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
